## How to use 🔧

### Using a scene
To start seeing a model you can drop any file from ```Game/Assets/Models``` into the screen. Alternatively you can load a scene going to ``` File -> Load -> Scene ``` and choosing the ```.scene``` file you want to use.

### Navigation
Scene navigation controls resemble the ones from unity:
* Move the camera as fps game using right click + W, A, S, D
* Orbit the model using Alt + mouse motion
* Pres F to focus on model

### Game Objects & Components
The engine is based arround hierarchies of game objects that have a set of components asociated to them. All game objects will have at least a transform.

You can edit the game objects distribution via the **scene hierarchy** by dragging them or using the contextual menu that pops up with right click. You can also select objects by clicking them on the scene (As long as they have a mesh).

To tweak components or create them you can select the desired game object and go to the **inspector**, Each compoentn has its own set of options.

Alternatively you can modify the transform using the **guizmo**, to change its current mode use the buttons at top left of the scene or the W, E, R keys.
