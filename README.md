# Altar Boy

Project for mastes degree, UPC Advancing programming AAA. A Game engine implemented with C++.

## Get Ready üöÄ

Move to develop and change the path directory project to \..\Game (if you want to debug)

### How works üîß

Is just unity, you have the same controls of the camera, are provided to two models to test drag an drop, so you can:

* Move the camera as fps game using W, A, S, D
* Orbit the model using Alt + mouse motion
* Pres F to focus on model

Theare are diferents GUIs to show configurations of the current model.
